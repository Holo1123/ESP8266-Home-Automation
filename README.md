# ESP8266-Home-Automation
A simple home automation project for our Electronic Devices and Circuits course. We used the ESP8266 micro-controller with the Blynk library.

The Objective of this project was to develop a device that our classmates would find useful and would be willing to buy for their personal use.
We went with the aim to create a low cost project (under Rs 5000 or 30$) as to make to accesible and cheap to manufacture.
We got an A for this course which was nice.

The device displays temperature and humidty levels for the room it was in and allowed automation of 2 electronic devices like Air conditioner and fan. It also had a C02 level detector that if triggered would alert the users through a buzzer and would automatically turn off the main gas supply of the room or home. We could also control the automation through voice control using the IFTTT server.We could also turn on or off the devices from anywhere in the world. Further more it supported battery back up as well as an adapter for power.
